  ## Green Coffee – Why Zuricaf?


  We deliver sustainably grown green coffee directly from Uganda — without detours and with full transparency. Our network spans cooperatives in Mount Elgon, Rwenzori, Masaka, Luwero and West Nile.


  ### Slow Food Coffee & Biodiversity


  As part of the international *Slow Food* movement we stand for **good, clean, fair**.


  #### Goals

  - Organic, eco-friendly farming to improve soil health.

  - Diversity of coffee varieties & companion plants for resilient agro-ecosystems.

  - Training & fair trade practices to improve farmers’ livelihoods.

  - Higher cup quality through better farming and processing methods.

  - Social projects & education as the backbone of a sustainable community.


  #### Implementation & Measurement

  - **Shade management:** tree distribution to mitigate heat & foster biodiversity.

  - **Continuous farmer trainings** on best practices & innovations.

  - **Monitoring & evaluation:** every project start and finish is documented by M&E officers.


  ### Golden Diversity – Species & Variety Wealth


  A diverse mosaic of flora and fauna is essential for healthy agro-ecosystems. Different species deliver key ecosystem services — from pollination to pest control. Studies like *Hooper & Vitousek (1997)* show: the higher the diversity, the more climate-resilient a system becomes.


  Diversity also pays socially: parallel cultivation of different crops allows smallholders to harvest year-round, stabilise income and differentiate from the bulk market.


  ### Trade for Aid – our values

  - **Direct trade:** At least 70% of the FOB price remains with producers — full transparency.

  - **Investing in the future:** 1% of every exported tonne flows into reforestation & gender-equity programmes.

  - **Holistic consulting:** From lot selection to logistics — all from one source.

  - **Deep-rooted network:** long-term partnerships with farming families, Canephora & NGO projects in Uganda.


  **What’s behind the name “Zuricaf”?** — *zuri* (Swahili for “beautiful”) + *CAF* (Coffee). In short: beautiful Ugandan coffee.

  ## Canephora & Liberica Initiatives in Uganda


  We love diversity and believe in its integral power to strengthen ecosystems and communities. Together with Canephora as well as Liberica and Excelsa farmers — and *Slow Food Uganda* — we explore the potential of climate-resilient coffee specialties.


  #### Project Goals

  - Long-term supply security: Liberica & Excelsa as robust complements to Arabica & Robusta.

  - Boost local value creation: trainings, on-site processing & fair prices.

  - Premium positioning: unique flavour profile (bold, fruity, gently sweet).

  - Climate action: agroforestry, efficient irrigation & renewable energy.


  **Status quo:** exchange & pilot phase — first micro-lots expected in 2026; international trade not yet started.
